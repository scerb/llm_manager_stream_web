Question:
Write a python app to calculate the time a ball will stay in the air given an initial velocity parameter

Answer:
Sure! Here's a simple Python application that calculates the time a ball will stay in the air given an initial velocity parameter:

```python
import math

def calculate_time_in_air(initial_velocity):
    g = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2)
    time_in_air = (2 * initial_velocity) / g
    return time_in_air

initial_velocity = float(input("Enter the initial velocity of the ball (m/s): "))
time_in_air = calculate_time_in_air(initial_velocity)
print("The ball will stay in the air for", time_in_air, "seconds.")
```

To use this application, simply run the script and enter the initial velocity of the ball when prompted. The application will then calculate and print the time the ball will stay in the air.

Note that this calculation assumes that the ball is thrown straight up and that there is no air resistance. In real-world scenarios, these assumptions may not hold true, and the calculation may need to be adjusted accordingly.
