Question:
Write a minimal Rust example that triggers a borrow checker error, then fix it and explain the change.

Answer:
Certainly! Let's start with an example that triggers a borrow checker error in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    let y = &x;
    x = 10; // This line will cause a borrow checker error
    println!("{}", y);
}
```

When you run this code, you'll get an error like this:

```
error[E0506]: cannot assign to `x` because it is borrowed
 --> src/main.rs:5:5
  |
3 |     let y = &x;
  |              - borrow occurs here
4 |     x = 10; // This line will cause a borrow checker error
  |     ^^^^^^ cannot assign to `x` because it is borrowed
```

The error occurs because `x` is borrowed by `y` and we are trying to mutate `x` afterwards. In Rust, you can't have a mutable reference to a variable while you have an immutable reference to it, and vice versa.

To fix this, you need to ensure that the borrow of `x` by `y` is dropped before you attempt to mutate `x`. One way to do this is to limit the scope of `y`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    {
        let y = &x;
        println!("{}", y);
    } // y goes out of scope here
    x = 10; // Now it's safe to mutate x
    println!("{}", x);
}
```

In this corrected version, the scope of `y` is limited to the inner `{}` block. By the time we reach the line `x = 10;`, `y` has gone out of scope, so the borrow of `x` by `y` has been dropped. This allows us to safely mutate `x`.
