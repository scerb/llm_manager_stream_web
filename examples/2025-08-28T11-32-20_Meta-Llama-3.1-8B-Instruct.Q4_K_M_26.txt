Question:
Write a regex to extract IPv4:port from logs and explain edge cases briefly.

Answer:
**IPv4:Port Extractor Regex**
```markdown
\b\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\:\d+\b
```
Let's break it down:

* `\b`: Word boundary to ensure we match the entire IP:port string, not part of another IP address.
* `\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}`: Matches the IPv4 address. Each part (octet) is matched with `\d{1,3}`, which allows 1-3 digits. The `.` is escaped with a backslash to match the literal dot character.
* `:`: Matches the colon separating the IP address from the port number.
* `\d+`: Matches one or more digits for the port number.

**Edge Cases:**

* **IP addresses with leading zeros**: The regex does not support IP addresses with leading zeros (e.g., `192.168.00.1`). To match these, use `\d{1,3}(?:\.\d{1,3}){3}` instead.
* **IPv4 addresses with more than 4 parts**: The regex does not support IP addresses with more than 4 parts (e.g., `192.168.0.1.2`). To match these, use a more permissive pattern, such as `\b\d{1,3}(?:\.\d{1,3}){3}(?:\.\d{1,3})?\b`.
* **Port numbers with leading zeros**: The regex does not support port numbers with leading zeros (e.g., `192.168.0.1:001`). To match these, use `\b\d+(?:\.\d+)?\b` instead.
* **IPv6 addresses**: The regex only supports IPv4 addresses. To match IPv6 addresses, use a more complex pattern that supports the IPv6 address syntax.

**Example Use Case**
```python
import re

log_line = "192.168.1.100:8080 - - [10/Jul/2000:13:30:00 +0000] \"GET / HTTP/1.0\" 200 1234"
match = re.search(r'\b\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\:\d
