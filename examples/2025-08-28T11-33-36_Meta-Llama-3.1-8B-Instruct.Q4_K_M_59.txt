Question:
ELI5: sockets vs HTTP APIs—what’s the difference and when to use each?

Answer:
Let's break it down in a super simple way:

**Sockets:**

Imagine you're having a conversation with a friend at a coffee shop. You both talk to each other directly, without needing a middleman. You can send a message, and your friend responds immediately. You can also have a continuous conversation, sending and receiving messages back and forth.

In computer terms, sockets are like a direct, two-way conversation between your app and a server. They allow your app to establish a connection with the server and send/receive data in real-time. Think of it like a phone call or a video chat.

**HTTP APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):**

Now, imagine you're sending a letter to your friend. You write a message, put it in an envelope, and give it to the postal service (e.g., HTTP). The postal service takes the letter, delivers it to your friend, and they respond with a letter of their own. This process takes a bit longer, as the postal service handles the delivery.

HTTP APIs work similarly. Your app sends an HTTP request (like a letter) to the server, and the server responds with an HTTP response (like a letter back). This is a one-way communication, where your app sends a request and the server responds, but there's no ongoing conversation.

**Key differences:**

1. **Real-time vs. asynchronous:** Sockets allow for real-time, two-way communication, while HTTP APIs are asynchronous and one-way.
2. **Connection establishment:** Sockets establish a connection between your app and the server, while HTTP APIs use a separate request-response cycle for each interaction.
3. **Data exchange:** Sockets can exchange data continuously, while HTTP APIs exchange data in discrete packets (requests and responses).

**When to use each:**

1. **Sockets:**
	* Real-time applications (e.g., live updates, gaming, video streaming).
	* Applications that require continuous, two-way communication (e.g., chat apps, collaborative editing).
2. **HTTP APIs:**
	* Applications that don't require real-time data exchange (e.g., web scraping, data aggregation).
	* Applications that need to interact with a server in a stateless, request-response manner (e.g., web services, API-based integrations).

In summary, sockets are for real-time, two-way communication, while HTTP APIs are for asynchronous, one-way communication. Choose sockets when you need real-time data exchange, and HTTP APIs when you need a more traditional request-response approach
