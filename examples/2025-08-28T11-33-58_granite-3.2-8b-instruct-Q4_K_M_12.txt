Question:
Define a labeling guide to classify support tickets into {P1,P2,P3} with decision thresholds and short examples.

Answer:
1. **Labeling Guide for Support Tickets (P1, P2, P3)**

   **Decision Thresholds:**

   - **P1 (Critical):** High impact on business operations or user experience. Immediate resolution required.
     - *Threshold*: High urgency, high impact.
     - *Example*: "The entire website is down, users cannot access any content."

   - **P2 (High):** Significant impact on user experience or business operations. Prompt resolution needed.
     - *Threshold*: High impact, moderate urgency.
     - *Example*: "Users are unable to save documents in the cloud service."

   - **P3 (Medium):** Minimal impact on user experience or business operations. Resolution within a reasonable timeframe.
     - *Threshold*: Low to moderate impact, low to moderate urgency.
     - *Example*: "The color scheme of the application is off, affecting readability."

2. **Labeling Guide: Step-by-Step Instructions**

   **Step 1: Understand the Ticket**

   - Read the entire support ticket to understand the issue, its context, and its impact.

   **Step 2: Identify Key Factors**

   - **Impact**: How severe is the issue on user experience or business operations?
     - *Critical*: High impact, e.g., system downtime, data loss.
     - *High*: Significant impact, e.g., major functionality loss, widespread user inconvenience.
     - *Medium*: Minimal to moderate impact, e.g., minor usability issues, cosmetic changes.
   - **Urgency**: How soon does the issue need to be resolved?
     - *High*: Immediate resolution required.
     - *Moderate*: Prompt resolution needed, but not immediately critical.
     - *Low*: Resolution within a reasonable timeframe.

   **Step 3: Apply the Decision Thresholds**

   - Based on the identified impact and urgency, assign the appropriate label (P1, P2, or P3).

   **Step 4: Justify Your Label**

   - Provide a brief explanation for your labeling decision. This helps maintain consistency and improves the model's understanding of the labeling criteria.

   **Example Justification:**

   - Ticket: "Users are experiencing slow load times when accessing certain pages."
     - *Label*: P3 (Medium)
     - *Justification*: The issue has a minimal impact
