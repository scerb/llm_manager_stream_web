Answer:

Okay, the user wants me to list clear rules for classifying sentences as positive, neutral, or negative, along with one example for each. Let me start by recalling what I know about sentiment analysis. 

First, I need to define the criteria for each category. Positive sentences usually express happiness, satisfaction, or good things. Negative ones are the opposite, like sadness or bad things. Neutral sentences are neutral, not expressing strong positive or negative emotions.

I should break down the rules into specific aspects. Maybe start with emotional words. Positive sentences might have words like "happy," "great," "love." Negative could have "sad," "bad," "hate." But I have to be careful because some words can be context-dependent. For example, "bad" can be negative or neutral depending on the context.

Then, there's the aspect of the sentence structure. Positive sentences might have exclamation marks, while negative ones might use words like "not" or "never." But exclamation marks can be used in neutral sentences too, so that's not a foolproof rule.

Another angle is the use of adjectives and adverbs. Positive sentences often use positive adjectives, negative ones use negative adjectives. Neutral sentences might use neutral adjectives like "normal" or "average."

Also, the presence of specific phrases or expressions. For example, "I love this" is clearly positive, while "I hate this" is negative. Neutral might be "This is okay."

Wait, but what about sentences that are ambiguous? Like "The weather is bad." That could be negative if it's raining, but maybe neutral if it's just not great. Hmm, maybe the rules need to be more about the presence of strong indicators rather than context.

So, the rules could be:

1. Presence of positive emotional words (e.g., happy, great, love) → positive.
2. Presence of negative emotional words (e.g., sad, bad, hate) → negative.
3. Use of exclamation marks or strong positive/negative verbs → positive/negative.
4. Neutral sentences lack strong emotional words or adjectives and don't use exclamation marks or strong verbs.

But I need to make sure these are clear and not overlapping. Also, examples are needed. Let me think of examples for each category.

Positive example: "I love the sunny weather!" (has positive emotion, exclamation)
Negative example: "This is the worst day ever." (negative emotion, strong words)
Neutral example: "
