Question:
Specify a procedure and Markdown template to extract action items with owners and due dates from meeting notes.

Answer:
To extract action items with owners and due dates from meeting notes, you can follow this procedure and use a Markdown template.

### Procedure

1. **Read the meeting notes**: Go through the meeting notes and identify action items.
2. **Identify owners and due dates**: For each action item, identify the person responsible (owner) and the deadline (due date).
3. **Create a structured list**: Organize the extracted information in a structured list format.

### Markdown Template

Here is a Markdown template to create a structured list of action items with owners and due dates:

```markdown
## Meeting Action Items

| Task Description | Owner | Due Date |
|---|---|---|
| **Action Item 1** |  |  |
| **Action Item 2** |  |  |
| **Action Item 3** |  |  |

---

**Additional Notes:**

- [Any relevant notes or context related to the action items]
```

### Steps to Fill the Template

1. **Replace placeholders**: Replace the placeholders in the table (e.g., `**Action Item 1**`, `Owner`, `Due Date`) with the actual information extracted from the meeting notes.
2. **Add more rows**: If there are more action items, add more rows in the table following the same format.
3. **Update additional notes**: If there are any additional notes or context related to the action items, include them in the `Additional Notes` section.

### Example

```markdown
## Meeting Action Items

| Task Description | Owner | Due Date |
|---|---|---|
| Prepare the presentation | John Doe | 2023-04-15 |
| Review the report | Jane Smith | 2023-04-10 |
| Send out the meeting summary | Bob Johnson | 2023-04-12 |

---

**Additional Notes:**

- The presentation should include the latest financial data.
- Make sure to proofread the report for any errors.
```

This template allows you to create a clear and organized list of action items, owners, and due dates for easy reference and follow-up.<|end_of_text|>
