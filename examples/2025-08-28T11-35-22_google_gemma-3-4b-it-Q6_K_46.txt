Question:
Translate “Our servers will undergo maintenance tonight from 22:00 to 02:00” into simple, non-technical English.

Answer:
Here are a few options for translating “Our servers will undergo maintenance tonight from 22:00 to 02:00” into simple, non-technical English, ranging from more formal to more casual:

**Option 1 (More Formal):**

“We’re going to be taking our computers offline tonight for some maintenance. It will happen between 10:00 PM and 2:00 AM.”

**Option 2 (Slightly Less Formal):**

“We’ll be doing some work on our computers tonight from 10:00 PM to 2:00 AM.  You might not be able to access everything during that time.”

**Option 3 (Most Casual):**

“Just letting you know our computers will be down for maintenance tonight from 10:00 PM to 2:00 AM.”

**Key Changes Made:**

*   “Servers” became “computers” – more relatable.
*   “Undergo maintenance” became “taking our computers offline” or “doing some work on our computers” – easier to understand.
*   “22:00 to 02:00” became “10:00 PM to 2:00 AM” – standard time format for most people.
*   Added a brief explanation of the potential impact (not being able to access everything).

Choose the option that best suits your audience and context.<end_of_turn>
