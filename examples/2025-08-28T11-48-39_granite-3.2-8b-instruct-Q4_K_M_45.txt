Question:
Rewrite a security policy into bullet-point compliance checks with testable acceptance criteria.

Answer:
To rewrite the security policy into bullet-point compliance checks with testable acceptance criteria, we will focus on key aspects of a secure coding practice policy. The original policy might include principles like least privilege, secure communication, input validation, error handling, and logging. Below are the compliance checks with corresponding testable acceptance criteria:

### Security Policy Compliance Checks

1. **Least Privilege Principle**
   - **Check 1.1**: Users are assigned the least privilege necessary to perform their tasks.
     - **Acceptance Criteria**:
       - Every user account has a role assigned.
       - Roles are defined with the minimal necessary permissions.
       - No user account has more permissions than required for their tasks.
   - **Check 1.2**: Regular audits are conducted to ensure the principle of least privilege is maintained.
     - **Acceptance Criteria**:
       - Quarterly reviews are conducted to verify that users have the minimum necessary roles/permissions.
       - A log of access rights reviews is maintained, documenting changes and justifications.

2. **Secure Communication**
   - **Check 2.1**: All communication uses secure protocols.
     - **Acceptance Criteria**:
       - HTTPS is used for all web communications.
       - Secure protocols (e.g., SSH, TLS) are enforced for data transmission.
       - No cleartext transmission of sensitive data is allowed.
   - **Check 2.2**: Secure configuration of network devices and services.
     - **Acceptance Criteria**:
       - Routers, switches, and firewalls are configured to use secure settings.
       - Regular checks verify that no unauthorized services are running.
       - Access to network devices is restricted to authorized personnel.

3. **Input Validation**
   - **Check 3.1**: All user inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks.
     - **Acceptance Criteria**:
       - Input validation is implemented on all endpoints accepting user input.
       - Known attack vectors (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting) are mitigated.
       - All inputs are sanitized or rejected if they do not meet expected formats.

4. **Error Handling**
   - **Check 4.1**: Robust error handling to prevent information leakage.
     - **Acceptance Criteria**:
       - Custom, non-verbose error messages are used to avoid exposing system details.
       - Error messages do not include technical stack traces or sensitive data.
       - Logging of errors is done securely without exposing sensitive information.

5. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - **Check 5.1**: Comprehensive logging to aid in detection and response.
     - **Acceptance Criteria**:
       - All significant actions are logged, including user actions and system events.
       - Logs are stored securely and are regularly reviewed for anomalies.
       - Log retention policies ensure that logs are stored for the required period and deleted securely.

6. **Secure Configuration Management**
   - **Check 6.1**: Secure configurations for all software components.
     - **Acceptance Criteria**:
       - Default configurations are changed to secure settings where applicable.
       - Regular scans are performed to detect and remediate misconfigurations.
       - Configuration changes are tracked and audited for compliance.

7. **Regular Security Updates and Patching**
   - **Check 7.1**: Timely application of security patches.
     - **Acceptance Criteria**:
       - A schedule for applying security updates is established and followed.
       - Patches are tested in a staging environment before deployment to production.
       - Records of applied patches and their effectiveness are maintained.

These compliance checks provide a structured approach to verifying that a software development environment adheres to a robust security policy, with each point accompanied by clear acceptance criteria that can be tested or verified.<|end_of_text|>
