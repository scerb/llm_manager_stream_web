Question:
Outline a framework to audit a 200-page codebase and output a structured report of modules, ownership, and TODOs.

Answer:
Auditing a 200-page codebase is a significant task that requires a structured approach to ensure all aspects are covered comprehensively. Below is a framework to audit the codebase and generate a structured report of modules, ownership, and TODOs.

### Framework: Audit 200-Page Codebase

#### 1. Preparation
- **Define Goals**: Clearly outline the objectives of the audit (e.g., find bugs, identify performance bottlenecks, improve code quality, etc.).
- **Set Scope**: Define the scope of the audit (e.g., all modules, specific features, etc.).
- **Team Setup**: Ensure a team of developers is available, each with clear roles and responsibilities.

#### 2. Initial Review
- **Read Documentation**: Review any available documentation to understand the architecture and design of the codebase.
- **Code Structure Analysis**: Break down the code into modules and sub-modules. Use tools like `grep` or IDE features to identify module boundaries.

#### 3. Module Identification
- **Identify Modules**: Use comments, imports, and function names to identify modules and sub-modules.
- **Ownership Mapping**: Identify the developers responsible for each module. This can be done by reviewing commit history, code comments, and team documentation.
- **Dependencies Mapping**: Map dependencies between modules to understand the flow of data and control.

#### 4. Code Review
- **Static Analysis**: Use tools like SonarQube, ESLint, or similar to perform static analysis and identify potential issues.
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Use tools like JUnit, pytest, or similar to test the code in various scenarios.
- **Code Quality**: Evaluate code quality using metrics like cyclomatic complexity, lines of code, etc.

#### 5. TODO Identification
- **Search for TODOs**: Use `grep` or IDE features to find all instances of `TODO`.
- **Evaluate TODOs**: Categorize TODOs into immediate, low priority, and deferred.
- **Prioritize**: Prioritize TODOs based on impact, urgency, and risk.

#### 6. Reporting
- **Report Structure**: Structure the report with sections for:
  - **Modules**: List all modules with their descriptions, dependencies, and ownership.
  - **TODOs**: List all TODOs with their descriptions, priority, and status.
  - **Issues**: List any identified issues and recommendations.
- **Ownership and Responsibility**: Clearly define who is responsible for each module and TODO.
- **Action Plan**: Provide a plan for addressing identified issues and TODOs.

#### 7. Documentation
- **Update Documentation**: Ensure that the updated documentation reflects the current state of the codebase.
- **Version Control**: Commit changes to version control with clear messages and descriptions.

#### 8. Follow-Up
- **Review and Iterate**: After the initial audit, review the report and iterate as necessary.
- **Feedback Loop**: Implement a feedback loop where developers can provide input and corrections.

### Tools and Resources
- **Version Control Systems**: Git, GitHub, Bitbucket
- **Code Review Tools**: Phabricator, GitLab, Pull Requests
- **Static Analysis Tools**: SonarQube, ESLint, Pylint
- **Dynamic Analysis Tools**: JUnit, pytest
- **IDEs**: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm

### Conclusion
By following this framework, you can systematically audit a 200-page codebase and produce a structured report that highlights the modules, their ownership, and any TODOs. This approach ensures that all aspects of the codebase are thoroughly reviewed and documented, leading to improved code quality and maintainability.
